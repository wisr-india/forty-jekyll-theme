Hello,

Let’s take a few seconds to come up with some names of accomplished Indian scientists. 

Any woman in your list? If none, you are not alone. It is perhaps because less than 15% of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) R&D taskforce in India is comprised of women. You would agree that this disparity between the number of men and women in STEM research is quite alarming, and that this has led to a dearth of role models and mentors for young women interested in STEM research in India.

WISR (Women in STEM Research) has been founded with a mission to alleviate this disparity and provide a gender-neutral level playing field for Indians in STEM.

We, at WISR, are a group of passionate and like-minded women in STEM research who have come together to build a vibrant community of women researchers in India across different STEM fields. We seek to promote collaboration among women pursuing or seeking to pursue careers in STEM by fostering a culture of inclusiveness and cooperation. Also, we envisage to organically proliferate a team of solicitous, accessible and leading professionals in STEM to inspire and mentor young Indian women in their career paths in STEM.

Interested? Here’s how you can help!

1. We would like to know more about the challenges that women are facing in their pursuit of higher education or careers in STEM research. 
2. We would also like to know what worked for women who have already established their research careers. This will help us structure the community and shape the mentorship platform optimally. 

We would be grateful if you can spare 5 - 10 minutes of your valuable time to fill out our survey form (here).

Are you excited to share some beneficial information with us? Write to us at (email).

If you are enthusiastic about what we are doing and would like to be a part of our community, join us! Register (here) and we will contact you soon! 

Best regards, 
WISR Team
